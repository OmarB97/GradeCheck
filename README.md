# GradeCheck

Warning: this is still in alpha stage!

GradeCheck is an application which does all the "hard work" for you so you don't have to worry about constantly checking your gradebook on T-Square all the time. Just took an exam? No worries, GradeCheck's got your back! It'll send you a notification when that grade has been entered in. It's as simple as that!

To obtain all required dependencies, simply run:

    npm install

And you can currently run the application by entering this into the terminal in the local file path:

    node main.js
